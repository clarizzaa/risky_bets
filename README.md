### i. Description of Dataset 
**Dataset name:** Diabetes Health Indicators Dataset   
**Source:** Kaggle [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mohankrishnathalla/diabetes-health-indicators-dataset/data)  
**Rows:** 100,000 patients  
**Columns:** ~31 features
**File:** 'diabetes_data.csv'  

**Brief summary:**  
This dataset contains 100,000 synthetic but clinically realistic patient profiles modeled after BRFSS survey patterns and medical research. It includes demographic, lifestyle, biometric, and laboratory features used to predict diabetes status, with no missing values and a moderately balanced target distribution. Because many indicators resemble real-world risk factors (such as blood pressure, cholesterol, physical activity, BMI, and education), the dataset is well suited for health-focused machine learning tasks that emphasize both predictive accuracy and interpretability.
